# Minimal emacs config
An attempt to simplify my life. So far works ok.

A little context. One day, my nrepl.el stopped working. I started removing plugins to localize the issue until i removed everything and still had the issue. I realized that it wasn't related to my config, but, after spending few hours, i thought that my emacs config became too complex.
I ditched my old config folder and started from empty init.el file. Added just the packages i use right now. Everything is in one file. Extreme simplicity.
